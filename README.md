Login API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This project demonstrates how to build a secure login API from scratch using Node.js and Express. It includes:

Password Encryption: Ensuring secure storage with bcrypt.
Database Integration: MongoDB for data persistence, managed with Prisma.
Route Handling: Clear structure with public and private routes for controlled access.
JWT Authentication: Secure token-based authentication for protected resources.
This API provides a robust login system with core authentication features ideal for scalable applications.
